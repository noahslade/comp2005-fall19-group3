Noah Slade - Participation Log

In this Iteration, I was in charge of making the 2 new Fully Dressed Use Case Descriptions as well
as revising the old Use Cases and Sequence Diagrams based on the feedback that was received from
Iteration 2. Advice and feedback of all my work was given by every member of the team to ensure that
the best possible results of each objective was had. I also minorly helped in the making of the 
Sequence Diagram for Saving a Game and the Logical Architecture Diagram.
