Hi,

Instructions on how to comiple and run the code
navigate in to the src Directory 
compile all the files with this command "javac *.java"
then write this command "java Blokus"

Things to note about the jar file Blokus.jar
I tried it on linux, windows, and mac at my place. It is working on all of these OS's but when I
tried running it on library labnet systems it didn't work due to their outdated JRE environment version
I was not able to update it since I am not the admin 
If you run in to same error while running Blokus.jar then
update your JRE environment with this command "sudo apt install default-jdk"

And thing about the code we have Implemented functionalities for the red shapes only as of now 
so run your tests on them only
