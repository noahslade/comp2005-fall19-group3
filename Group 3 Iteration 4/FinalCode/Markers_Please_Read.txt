1.Compile instructions - javac *.java
2.Running game- java Blokus 

Things to Note
The game is being implemented for a 4 player game, so if the user choses no. of players to 1, then the total no. of cpu automatically get assigned to 3.
if the no. of players are 4, then the could be move on to color selection panel(if the random is chosen as No) or board(if random color is chosen as yes)

The Game only includes Easy and Medium Difficuly
Easy AI- Skips too many turn if it fails to find a piece.
MediumAI- Try to go over the whole container to make a valid move(which means it doesn't skip turns often as compared to EasyAI) and it always tries to place the pieces with most blocks after the first move.

Regarding a Final Score- There was a confusion with this statement, which later on I discussed it with Prof. Mark, He told me to put the statement and let you guys know How 
I interpreted it, so here is the statement

"plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece they placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square)"

Here is my interpretation of it
"When Game gets over, I check what was the last piece placed by the user on the board, if it's a one square then I award them 5 points"

Score- The way I have calculated score and the winner is who places the most of the pieces on the board, there is one point/ per square in the piece.

Issues-
Every Component of our code is working except for the load, I mean it's working but it's not working as it's supposed to be". Please Be lenient on this. It would be really 
helpful for us.

That's all 
Thank You
